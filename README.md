# MLAI_Module17

## Overview
This project is a Practical Assignment Module 17. Here I compare the performance of the classifiers namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. 

## Goal
I have utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone. The goal of this project is to predict if a client will subscribe the deposit, not regarding which amount is retained, turning it a classification task. Specifically for the business, the goal is to increase efficiency of directed campaigns for long-term deposit subscriptions by reducing the number of contacts to do.

## Dataset and Notebook

## Findings 

1. The most important bank information features that were selected are students, age, retired folks, illiterate, default_no, unemployed and married folks.
2. Using default parameters:
		a. the best accuracy models are Baseline, logistic regression and SVM models.
		b. the fastest models are Baseline and Decision Tree models.
3. After tuning for the best parameters:
		a. the best accuracy models are 
		b. the best precision score models are
4. Overall, for this task, the best model in my opinion is 


## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. Models are not very good due to the imbalance of classes. So next step could be to:
		a. Collect more data
		b. Undersample majority class
		c. Oversample the minority class
2. Try training the models with not just the bank information features but all the other features as well.
